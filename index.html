    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm George Pauer, a passionate software 
        developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and web development 
        technologies. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        I specialize in building dynamic and interactive web applications. 
        I have also honed my skills in modern frameworks like React and Node.js, 
        enabling me to create seamless user experiences and efficient server-side solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey in software development has extended beyond coding. 
        I have gained valuable experience in DevOps practices,  working 
        with tools such as Jenkins, OpenShift, and Kubernetes clusters. 
        This expertise allows me to streamline the deployment and management 
        of applications, ensuring smooth operations in production environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Driven by a constant desire to learn and grow, I am always exploring new 
        technologies and staying up to date with industry trends. 
        I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with 
        cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.
    </p>
